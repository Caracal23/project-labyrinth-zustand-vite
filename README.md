### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We started by making the Zustand store for all the global states. Then we made components to house our play area and our welcome area. Tried to make as many reusable components as possible. If we had more time we would like to add in disabled buttons to make the UI more understandable.
